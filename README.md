# Soulsborne Mini Encyclopedia

Need more information about the some of the amazing games from FromSoftware? Then you are in the right place. They have a popular 'genre' of games known as 'soulsborne' games. 'Soulsborne' games include Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2, Bloodborne, Dark Souls 3, and Elden Ring. While Elden Ring does not technically fall into this list I decided to add it because it is their newest game that is heavily influenced by the games listed above. It is essentially the be all game in the series, in my opinion.
